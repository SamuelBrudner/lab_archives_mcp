abstract: >-
  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects AI assistants to
  LabArchives electronic lab notebooks. Enables researchers to chat with
  their lab data, search notebooks semantically using vector embeddings,
  and integrate lab work into AI-assisted workflows. Includes a modular,
  backend-agnostic vector database framework for semantic search.
