** Abstract

Research labs increasingly rely on electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) such as LabArchives to manage experimental records, yet these systems remain largely siloed from modern AI assistants. =lab_archives_mcp= addresses this gap by exposing LabArchives notebooks, pages, and entries as tools under the Model Context Protocol (MCP), together with a configurable vector search backend for semantic retrieval over notebook content. The system allows AI assistants to navigate notebooks, perform concept-level search, maintain multi-session project contexts, and archive computational outputs with rich provenance metadata, without duplicating ELN records outside institutional infrastructure. The software is implemented in Python and available on GitHub and Zenodo under the MIT License.

** Introduction

As AI capabilities advance, context-aware architectures have the potential to participate in scientific research as cognitive assistants. To be most helpful, these systems need information about the past and ongoing work and processes of the lab. Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) serve as central repositories for research data and laboratory records, while Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful interfaces for querying complex information. However, these systems are often disconnected: ELN records are siloed within their platforms, and LLMs are restricted to their pre-trained knowledge.

=lab_archives_mcp= addresses this gap by providing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects AI assistants to LabArchives, a widely used commercial ELN, together with a modular, backend-agnostic semantic search framework based on a vector database. LabArchives was selected as the integration target because it is a dominant platform in academic research with widespread institutional licensing (e.g., at Yale University, Cornell, Caltech), offers a comprehensive and documented API, and provides a hierarchical structure (Notebooks > Pages > Entries, with folder organization) that maps naturally to file-system-like navigation.

The intended users are wet-lab researchers, research data management (RDM) teams, and institutional platform engineers who want to make ELN content available to AI assistants. The main contributions are (i) an MCP-based connector for LabArchives that can serve as a template for other ELNs and LIMS, (ii) a reusable vector search backend that can be adopted independently of LabArchives for institutional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows, and (iii) a graph-based state management layer that models research context as a persistent network of pages and findings.

While LabArchives and other ELN platforms expose REST APIs for CRUD operations, these interfaces typically rely on keyword search and leave indexing, semantic retrieval, and AI integration as downstream implementation details. Existing open-source tools focus on exporting ELN data or integrating ELNs into LIMS workflows rather than exposing them directly to AI assistants. In contrast, =lab_archives_mcp= provides an MCP-native connector that publishes LabArchives notebooks, pages, and entries as typed tools discoverable by AI assistants, together with a configuration-driven semantic search backend. To our knowledge, this represents one of the first academic applications of the Model Context Protocol to research data management.

** Implementation and architecture

=lab_archives_mcp= is organized into six primary components that separate authentication, API access, MCP integration, semantic search, persistent state management, and upload/provenance tracking:

1. *Authentication layer* (=auth.py=): Implements HMAC-SHA512 request signing for the LabArchives REST API, manages secure credential loading from configuration files or environment variables, and provides user ID resolution flows.

2. *API client* (=eln_client.py=): Wraps the LabArchives API using an async HTTP client, provides methods for listing notebooks, traversing page hierarchies, and reading entries, and translates XML responses into validated JSON using Pydantic models.

3. *MCP server* (=mcp_server.py=): Exposes notebook operations as MCP tools using the FastMCP framework. Tools are grouped into Discovery (=list_notebooks=, =list_pages=), Reading (=read_page=), Search (=search_labarchives=), and Index Management (=sync_vector_index=). An experimental =upload_to_labarchives= tool enables upload of artefacts with provenance metadata.

4. *Vector backend* (=vector_backend/=): Implements a configuration-driven pipeline for semantic search with pluggable text chunking strategies, embedding providers, and vector indices (including Pinecone, Qdrant, and local Parquet-based storage). Uses Hydra-based configuration so parameters are declared in YAML rather than hard-coded.

5. *State management layer* (=state.py=): Maintains persistent project contexts that scope multi-session research work. Models project state as a NetworkX graph, tracking relationships between pages, findings, and projects. Publishes MCP tools for project lifecycle, evidence capture, and graph navigation.

6. *Upload and provenance layer* (=models/upload.py=): Provides a high-level upload API for archiving computational artefacts directly into LabArchives pages, capturing rich provenance metadata including Git commit SHA, repository URL, execution timestamp, Python version, and dependency versions.

The vector backend and state management layer are intentionally packaged as reusable components: institutions that do not use LabArchives can still adopt them for RAG pipelines and stateful agent architectures over other content sources.

** Quality control

The project employs both automated and manual quality control measures. The automated test suite includes unit tests for authentication, notebook navigation, and vector-backend components, as well as integration tests that exercise full workflows (listing notebooks, reading pages, running semantic search, and performing uploads) against a live LabArchives account when credentials are available. It also covers the state management layer (project creation/switching, graph persistence, related-page heuristics). Continuous integration via GitHub Actions runs these tests on Linux and macOS for Python 3.11+, installing the project via the pinned conda-lock environment.

In addition to automated checks, the MCP server has been tested against real LabArchives notebooks from an institutional account, verifying notebook listing, navigation, semantic search behaviour, and upload workflows.

* Availability

** Operating system

Linux (tested on Ubuntu via GitHub Actions) and macOS (tested on macOS 12+). No Windows testing has been performed, but the software should work on any platform supporting Python 3.11+.

** Programming language

Python 3.11 or higher.

** Additional system requirements

No special hardware requirements. Internet connectivity is required for LabArchives API access and (optionally) for cloud-based vector stores and embedding APIs.

** Dependencies

Key dependencies include: FastMCP (MCP server framework), httpx (async HTTP client), Pydantic (data validation), NetworkX (graph modelling), Hydra (configuration management), and optionally OpenAI/Pinecone/Qdrant client libraries for the vector backend. A complete, pinned environment is provided via =conda-lock.yml=.

* Reuse potential

The design of =lab_archives_mcp= prioritizes reuse at three levels: as a concrete connector for LabArchives, as a reference architecture for ELN/AI integration, and as a set of reusable agent design patterns.

*Template for other ELN and LIMS systems:* The separation between authentication, API client, MCP server, vector backend, and state management allows developers to replace only the =eln_client.py= layer when targeting a different ELN or LIMS. Developers adapting this architecture to other systems (e.g. BioRAFT, Benchling, or eLabFTW) can preserve the project context abstraction and graph navigation logic while swapping out only the underlying API calls.

*Standalone vector backend:* The vector backend can be used independently of LabArchives to build institutional RAG pipelines over other content types, such as lab wikis or institutional repositories. Hydra-managed configuration makes it straightforward to tune chunking, embedding models, and storage backends for new domains without modifying code.

*Reusable agent architecture patterns:* The state management layer (=state.py=) provides a general-purpose pattern for maintaining assistant memory across sessions, applicable to any MCP server that needs to track long-running tasks. The graph-based navigation approach (using NetworkX to model semantic relationships) can be adapted to other domains where content relationships extend beyond hierarchical structure. The onboarding payload system (=onboard.py=) offers a transparent, inspectable way to instruct assistants about server capabilities.

*Institutional deployment:* Research data management teams can deploy the MCP server as part of an institutional AI assistant, exposing ELN content under existing authentication and logging policies. The project documents multiple deployment options for the vector backend, including local Parquet persistence and self-hosted vector stores, allowing institutions to keep embeddings and metadata on-premise when required.

*Support:* Issues and feature requests are tracked via the GitHub issue tracker. Contribution guidelines, including development setup, testing, and release procedures, are documented in =CONTRIBUTING.md=.
